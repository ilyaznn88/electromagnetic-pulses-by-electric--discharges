# electromagnetic-pulses-by-electric—Å-discharges
The results of the laboratory experiment described in the paper named "Nanosecond electromagnetic pulses generated by electric discharges: observation with clouds of charged water droplets and implications for lightning" by Gushchin M.E. et al.
Data files are in data folder.
Pictures **PicA.png**, **PicB.png**, **PicC.png**, **PicD.png** are the photos of the discharge events accompanied by microwave bursts. Exposure was of 70 mks, a camera was turned on 45 degrees.
* PicA -- collision of streamer zones.
* PicB -- start of the positive leader. 
* PicC -- a spark discharge in the form of a collision of the negative (top) and positive (bottom) leaders.
* PicD -- a spark at the return stroke stage.

File **calibration.csv** contains results of simultaneous calibration of inductive TPMP probe used for measuring of magnetic field pulses, and two trip-line IPPL probes for measuring of electric field pulses. The calibration procedure is described at the paper. The data presented with the comma-separated values (CSV) format. First column is a time grid in seconds, second column is a magnetic H field measured in A/m. Third and fourth columns is electric field E strength measured in V/m. First row is a legend.
Files **photomultiplier.csv**, **current.csv**, and **horn.csv.zip** are results of simultaneous measuring of light emission, current and EM radiation of a discharge. All files were written with CSV format. First column is the time grid, second is measured value. Values and measuring units described in a legend, written at first line of each file. **horn.csv.zip** is compressed.
Measurements of ultrawideband electromagnetic pulses of spark discharges presented at files **ser7_17.csv**, **ser7_17_14.csv**, **ser7_17_21.csv**. Data was written with CSV format like **calibration.csv**.
